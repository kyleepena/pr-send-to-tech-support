# Send to Tech Support – A UXP Panel for Adobe Premiere Pro

**Send to Tech Support** is a lightweight panel extension for Adobe Premiere Pro designed to make it easier for users to report technical issues accurately and efficiently. Built as part of Adobe Innovation Week 2025, this panel helps editors gather key diagnostic information about their editing environment in a clean, copyable format.

> “Because describing your sequence settings *shouldn’t* be harder than editing your timeline.”

---

## ✨ Features

* 📋 One-click collection of key diagnostic data:

  * Premiere version
  * OS and version, CPU, GPU/driver info (GPU is mocked)
  * Sequence settings including frame size and frame rate
  * Media in sequence
  * Third party plugins (mocked)

* ✅ Copy to Clipboard

Upon paste, four additional questions are added for the user to complete when posting for support online:

* Issue: (A short description of the problem)
* Steps to Reproduce: (A numbered list of the exact steps needed to hit this issue.)
* Expected Result: (What should happen.)
* Actual Result: (What does happen.)

## 🧪 Current Status

This is an Innovation Week prototype. Some data is currently mocked for demonstration purposes, but the panel structure is built to support real API integrations as UXP permissions allow. Additionally, the panel does not yet dynamically update with each new sequence.
